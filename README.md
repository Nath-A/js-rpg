## Process pour s'organiser par rapport à ca
### Player 1
**Challenge 1:**  
Create an HTML page with the following elements included:

- A title.
- An element to display both characters stats (visual, name, item, health...) - Something like a VS screen
- A panel with 6 buttons, 3 for each player (hit, heal & yield. Those are the moves.)
- A creation panel with inputs & dropdowns to create your character. (For now only name, items and race )
- A log that will tell you which move the player made.

**Challenge 2:**  
Use the character.js file and save the inputs inside variables/an object, and use them to initiate new characters for both players.

**Challenge 3:**  
Make sure that only the title, VS screen and the input field are visible when creating the characters.

**Challenge 4 :**  
When the characters are created, the creation panel should disappear. After this, the moves & log panel should appear.

**Challenge 5 :**  
Display the health bar of both players this should work real-time. Make sure it has a decrease/increase animation Make use of max-health and currentHealth.

### Player 2
**Challenge 1:**  
Create a js file named gamelogic.js. You are in charge of writing the game itself. Take a look at the character.js file you will have to use it.

Note: You will have to work with this file as well. Its up to you to find out what belongs where.

**Challenge 2:**  
Initiate a temporary character. We will use this to test our game logic.

**Challenge 3:**  
Write a function that will handle the races. This will only run once.

**Challenge 4:**  
Write a function that will handle the items. This will be called everytime we make a move.

**Challenge 5:**  
Make the functions work with the character. See if the stats change on creation.

**Challenge 6:**  
Lower the health of your object and create a healing function that will use the heal function. (character.js) Make it so the function uses a random number between the minHealing and maxHealing.

Note: The currentHealth should NEVER go above the maxHealth
